      <p>
        I am a second year student studying Software Development and Network
        Enigneering at Sheridan College. My aim is to solve trivial problems
        using various technologies and to carry out daily tasks as effecient as
        possible with the help of coding. I have a strong eagerness to learn and
        is always ready to take on new challenges. I believe there is always
        something new we can learn every day.
